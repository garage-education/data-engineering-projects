## General Guidance

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Use these best practices to keep your projects consistent, reliable, and easy to maintain.

1. **Testing Python Code with `pytest`**  
   - **Objective**: Ensure your Python scripts (ETL, data transformations, utilities) work as intended and remain stable under changes.  
   - **Best Practices**:
     - Write tests that cover both expected and edge cases.  
     - Organize tests in a `tests/` directory, each test file named `test_*.py`.  
     - Keep tests small and focused on one function or behavior.  
     - Run tests frequently (locally, in CI) to catch regressions early.

2. **Integration Tests with `docker-compose`**  
   - **Objective**: Validate interactions between your application/code and external services (e.g., Postgres, Spark, APIs) in a realistic environment.  
   - **Best Practices**:
     - Use a `docker-compose.yml` file to define containers for databases, data stores, or third-party services.  
     - Spin up containers for the test environment, run your integration tests, then tear everything down.  
     - Keep these tests separate from unit tests, as they may be slower or more resource-intensive.

3. **Code Quality: Linting and Formatting**  
   - **Objective**: Maintain consistent coding style and prevent common mistakes or code smells.  
   - **Best Practices**:
     - Use a **linter** (e.g., **Flake8**, **Pylint**) to detect issues (undefined variables, unused imports).  
     - Use a **formatter** (e.g., **Black**, **Autopep8**) to standardize indentation, spacing, and line lengths.  
     - **Always** run linting/formatting—either locally before committing or via pre-commit hooks—to ensure code consistency across the team.

4. **Git Pre-Commit Hooks**  
   - **Objective**: Automate checks that run _before_ code is committed, preventing errors or style violations from entering the repo.  
   - **Best Practices**:
     - Use a framework like **pre-commit** to configure hooks for linting, formatting, or security checks.  
     - Hooks reject commits that fail lint rules or formatting.  
     - This ensures code always meets minimum quality standards.

5. **Always Deploy Using CI/CD (with Tests & Integration Tests)**  
   - **Objective**: Automate the build, test, and deployment process so code changes are verified and released quickly and confidently.  
   - **Best Practices**:
     - Configure pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to run unit tests, lint checks, and integration tests.  
     - Fail the pipeline if any check or test fails.  
     - Deploy only after passing all stages, ensuring robust releases.

6. **Try Mocking Tests**  
   - **Objective**: In tests, replace (or “mock”) external services (APIs, databases) with controlled “fake” responses, keeping tests fast and isolated.  
   - **Best Practices**:
     - Use mocking libraries (e.g., `unittest.mock`, `pytest-mock`) to emulate external dependencies.  
     - Verify your logic without making real network calls or changing real data.  
     - Combine mocking tests (fast, isolated) with integration tests (real environment) for thorough coverage.

7. **Use Dev Containers (Devcontainer)**  
   - **Objective**: Standardize your development environment so every team member (including CI systems) uses the same dependencies, tools, and configurations.  
   - **Best Practices**:
     - Create a **`.devcontainer/`** folder with a **`Dockerfile`** or reference to a base image that includes Python, necessary libraries, and lint/test tools.  
     - Configure VS Code (or another IDE) to use the dev container automatically, ensuring consistent local dev and easier onboarding.  
     - Sync the dev environment with your CI environment so the same versions of Python, libraries, and system dependencies are used everywhere.

8. **Always Put Linting and Formatting Front and Center**  
   - **Objective**: From the moment you set up a project, ensure code style is enforced consistently to avoid “style drift” and merge conflicts.  
   - **Best Practices**:
     - Document your lint and format processes (e.g., “Run `black . && flake8 .` before committing”).  
     - Integrate them into your dev container configuration, pre-commit hooks, and CI.  
     - Use a standard config file (like `pyproject.toml` for Black) so the entire team (and CI) uses the same style rules.

---

> [!SUMMARY]  
> **By following these general practices, junior developers can**:  
> - **Improve reliability**: Automated tests (unit + integration) catch issues early.  
> - **Enhance maintainability**: Standardized linting/formatting keeps code readable.  
> - **Ensure consistency**: Git pre-commit hooks and dev containers align local and CI environments.  
> - **Optimize development flow**: Quick feedback loops (via mocking and CI/CD) let you iterate rapidly without unexpected production issues.

Incorporate these steps into each data engineering project—whether building ETL pipelines, analytics workflows, or machine learning models—to maintain **high-quality, scalable, and resilient** solutions.
